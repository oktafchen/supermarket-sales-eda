- Is it effective if we create members for customers?
- Is the transaction time (hour or day) different between member and non-member customers?
- Of all the existing branches, which branch customers have the least to register as members?

## üìå Insight Utama

1. Customer members have been proven to contribute significantly to revenue.
    This shows that the member program is quite effective financially.

2. There are different behavioral patterns between members and non-members in terms of transaction time.
    This can be used to develop a more targeted time-based promotion strategy.

3. The distribution of members is not evenly distributed across all branches.
    Some branches still have the potential for growth in the number of members if a more intensive approach is taken (eg: local referral programs or special member events).

###The membership program has been proven to contribute significantly to revenue, and shows unique transaction patterns that can be further utilized. It is recommended to increase member participation in branches with low participation through local loyalty programs, as well as conduct further analysis of repeat purchase behavior to form a long-term retention strategy.
